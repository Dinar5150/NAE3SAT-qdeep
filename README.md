# Not-all-equal 3-satisfiability (NAE3SAT)

NAE3SAT is an NP-complete boolean satisfiability problem. A problem is formulated by generating clauses of three variables (or variable negations), and requiring that the three elements are not equal to each other (ie. all configurations except `000` and `111` are valid).

In this example we explore the process of solving these type of satisfiability instances with two different generations of D-Wave QPUs: A Pegasus-topology Advantage system, and our newly released Zephyr-topology Advantage2_prototype. In particular, we will cover the Ising formulation of NAE3SAT instances, the process of embedding them into the QPU graphs, and the analysis of the solution quality obtained from both QPUs.

# Usage

To run the example:
```bash
python nae3sat_example.py
```

**Note:** The data in this document was generated with this code example, but results will slightly vary from run to run.

## Ising Formulation

NAE3SAT problems can be mapped to the Ising model by anti-ferromagnetically coupling the variables of a clause. As an example here we show a clause for variables {$s_0$, $s_1$, $s_2$}:

$H(s_0, s_1, s_2) = s_0s_1 + s_1 s_2 + s_2 s_0$

Note below that the not-all-equal confiurations have a lower energy than the all-equal ones.

|$s_0$| $s_1$|$s_2$|$E$|
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
|-1| -1| -1|3|
| 1| -1| -1|-1|
| 1|  1| -1|-1|
|-1|  1| -1|-1|
|-1|  1|  1|-1|
| 1|  1|  1|3|
| 1| -1|  1|-1|
|-1| -1|  1|-1|

If a variable is negated, we spin-reverse transform that variable. For example, if we negate $s_1$ (denoted by $\bar{s_1}$), the Ising Hamiltonian of that clause would take the following form instead:

$H(s_0, \bar{s_1}, s_2) = -s_0s_1 -s_1 s_2 + s_2 s_0$

A full problem is generated by adding clauses together:

$H(s_0, \dots, s_N) = H(s_0, s_1, s_2) + H(s_6, \bar{s_1}, s_4) + H(\bar{s_3}, s_5, \bar{s_9}) + \dots$

NAE3SAT problems are known to transition from the satisfiable to the unsatisfiable regime at a clause-to-variable ratio $\rho=2.1$. In this code example we solve problems with $\rho=2.1$ (critical point) as well as with $\rho=3.0$ (max-sat regime). Below we just show $\rho=3.0$ for simplicity.

## Embedding

Both the Pegasus and Zephyr topology have native graph triangles that allow embedding individual clauses directly (without chains). Nevertheless, a full problem typically includes interactions between variables that are not natively provided by the graph. This requires us to minor-embed the problems onto the QPU.

Here we minor-embed the problems into the two topologies using the `minorminer` heuristic in D-Wave Ocean. Below we show the distribution of chain lengths in the embeddings of a $\rho=3.0$.

Note that the Zephyr topology of Advantage2_prototype has a greater connectivity than the Pegasus topology of Advantage. This allows minor-embedding problems more compactly (with shorter chains) in Advantage2_prototype. More compact embeddings typically improve the success of Quantum Annealing computations.

## Solution quality

Below we show the solution quality of 100 samples from a $\rho=3.0$ problem.

We see that Advantage2_prototype tends to obtain lower energy samples than Advantage.
